# LAPS Group Logo Guidelines

## Logo Overview

The LAPS Group logo is a minimalist, enterprise-grade identity system designed to represent our five divisions through a simple yet sophisticated geometric mark.

## Design Concept

### Visual Elements

**Four-Square Symbol**
- A 2×2 grid of four squares representing the letters L-A-P-S
- Each square symbolizes one or more divisions of the LAPS Group
- Progressive opacity creates visual depth and hierarchy

**Wordmark**
- Primary text: **LAPS** (bold, tight tracking)
- Secondary text: **GROUP** (smaller, wide letter-spacing, reduced opacity)
- Stacked vertical layout for compact presentation

### Color Palette

**Primary Color: Gold**
- RGB: `rgb(201, 162, 39)`
- Hex: `#C9A227`
- Usage: All four squares with varying opacity

**Opacity Progression:**
- Square 1 (Top-Left): 100% opacity
- Square 2 (Top-Right): 75% opacity
- Square 3 (Bottom-Left): 50% opacity
- Square 4 (Bottom-Right): 25% opacity

## Symbolism & Meaning

### Four Squares = Five Divisions

Each square represents one letter of "LAPS", mapping to our five business divisions:

1. **L** (Square 1, 100% opacity)  
   **Landscape + Architecture + Planning Studios**  
   - Architecture & Planning Division
   - Tagline: "Designing Tomorrow's Spaces"

2. **A** (Square 2, 75% opacity)  
   **Applications/Ads** - Dual Representation  
   - **Launchpad for Applications & Platforms** (Apps & Platforms Division)
   - **Launchpad for Ads & Services** (Ads & Services Division)
   - Both divisions share the "A" letterform

3. **P** (Square 3, 50% opacity)  
   **Living and Party Suites**  
   - LAPS Suites Division
   - Tagline: "Curating Unforgettable Moments"

4. **S** (Square 4, 25% opacity)  
   **Lifestyle and Photography Studios**  
   - LAPS Studios Division
   - Tagline: "Capturing Life's Canvas"
