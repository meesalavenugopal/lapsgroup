## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/pages/LaunchPresentation.tsx` - Main presentation component

---

## Rationale

These changes reflect realistic expectations for a **startup division** rather than an established enterprise unit:

1. **Leaner Operations**: Smaller core team with realistic scaling projections
2. **Focused Market Entry**: 3 cities instead of 12 for concentrated effort
3. **Conservative Projections**: 26-35 total projects Year 1 vs. 60-80
4. **Efficient Investment**: ₹35L vs. ₹66.5L for lean startup approach
5. **Accelerated Timeline**: 1-2 months to market instead of phased 12-month rollout
6. **Realistic Growth**: Sustainable metrics aligned with startup resources
